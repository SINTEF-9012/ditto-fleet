  # [[outputs.mqtt]]
  ## MQTT Brokers
  ## The list of brokers should only include the hostname or IP address and the
  ## port to the broker. This should follow the format `[{scheme}://]{host}:{port}`. For
  ## example, `localhost:1883` or `mqtt://localhost:1883`.
  ## Scheme can be any of the following: tcp://, mqtt://, tls://, mqtts://
  ## non-TLS and TLS servers can not be mix-and-matched.
  # servers = ["tcp://host.docker.internal:1883"]
  # servers = ["tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883"]
  # or ["mqtts://tls.example.com:1883"]

  # topic_prefix = "ditto-fleet-agent"

  ## QoS policy for messages
  ## The mqtt QoS policy for sending messages.
  ## See https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.dev.doc/q029090_.htm

  ## For version v2.0.12 and later mosquitto there is a bug
